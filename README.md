Experimenting with various heuristic search for solving problems that can be formulated as dynamic programming (DP). 

#### Heuristic Search
- One-step lookahead with rollout
- Two-step lookahead with rollout: 
- Selective-depth lookahead with rollout
- Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS)
- Depth-First search (DFS)
- Backtracking search (a.k.a DFS with pruning)


#### Testbed Problems
- Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)
